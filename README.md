## What was done in this project(Description):
* The main focus of this project was MongoDb Integration & firebase Authentication. Making a realTime Database and interacting with it is also one of the major focuses.
* Also Implemented Login and signup with Email-password , google , github with the help of firebase.
* For the very First time I implemented Dynamic title for every single route.
*  There is also added a Feature of Private is repeated inspiring by my previous project, here i implemented private route for "Add service" and "My reviews" route
* In some portions I have used the react "useContext" hook to distribute the user data and the others function through the Project code and files.
*  There many kinds of functionalities have been implemented , most importantly "useAuthStateChange '' for holding the state of the user and the unSubscribe function for preventing memory leak.
* The Most Fascinating thing used in this Project is "JWT/ Json Web Token". It was used For saving our private data of our user. No one can Access the Data without A token.
